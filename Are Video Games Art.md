# Are Video Games Art

## Abstract
In this paper I argue that by any major definition of art many modern video games should be considered art. Rather than defining art and defending video games based on a single contentious definition, I offer reason for thinking that video games can be art.

## Introduction
Jack Kroll argues that "games can be fun and rewarding in many ways, but they can't transmit the emotional complexity that is the root of art".

In an article published in MIT's Technology Review called "Art Form for the digital Age", film scholar Henry Jenkins criticized Kroll for dramatically underestimating the potential of video games.

Despite the cultural prominence of video games and technology-based art, philosophical aesthetics has completely ignored the area.

The fact that philosophers have not raised the question of whether video games can be art lends credence to assumption that they are not.

In this paper I argue that by any major definition of art many modern video games should be considered art.

If we can agree that all these theories generally track our intuitions about what should be considered art, then when they are all in agreement we have good reason to think that we have successfully picked out an art form.

Overall, I argue that while many video games probably should not be considered art, there are good reasons to think that some video games should be classified as art.

## Three Candidate Games
It will be useful to give a brief description of a few important games from which I will draw key examples. Max Payne (2001), Halo (2001), and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (2002) are three recent games that have earned significant critical acclaim. The sophistication of these games indicates the promising aesthetic potential of the purported art form.

Max Payne is a third-person shooter, a game where the camera takes a perspective from slightly behind the character, allowing the player to control the direction in which the character looks and moves.

The elaborate plot, complete with double-crossings and evidence of conspiracies spiraling out the highest levels, helps to evoke the classic noir-inspired dread.


Halo, is an elaborate science fiction adventure set in an artificial world. The game mixes play modes, moving from the first-person perspective of a cyborg warrior, to driving and flying modes of play.

Much of the pleasure in playing the game derives from slowly uncovering the purpose of the world on which your army has crash-landed.

Splinter Cell, is renowned for its graphics and life-like character movement. In the game's jingoistic narrative, you play a secret operative set to infiltrate a hostile country.

The game features a complex plot, extremely detailed character movements and elaborate lighting effects.

I do not claim that any of these games are great art, but they are all adept at achieving the goals they set for themselves, goals of provoking specific emotions that are typical of similar genres in other art forms.

## Where's the Art?
Video games combine elements from narrative fiction film, music and sports. They are arguably an art or sister art of the moving image, specifically, a form of digital animation.

Although we may say that a baseball pitcher has a beautiful arm or that a boxer is graceful, when judging sports like baseball, hockey, soccer, football, basketball and boxing, the competitors are not formally evaluated on aesthetic grounds. However, sports such as gymnastics, diving and ice skating are evaluated in large part by aesthetic criteria.

However, it is fairly obvious that competition does not deny something of art status. Greek tragedies were explicitly entered into competitions, but no one seriously denies that they are art because of their competitive provenance.

Does Hamlet cease to be art because the audience is encouraged to side with Hamlet against his father's killer?

We should not confine the audience of video games to players, since often games are played with an audience.

Although playing video games usually involves a smaller audience-to-competitor ratio, there is no reason why the audience watching someone play a game must be smaller than the audience of non-competitors at a poetry slam.

We should not ignore the aesthetic experience of the performers of art works. The video game player can plausibly be considered a performer in a larger video game performance.

We must ask, does not even the amateur musician have aesthetic or artistic experiences?
