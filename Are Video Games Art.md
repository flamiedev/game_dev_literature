# Are Video Games Art

## Abstract
In this paper I argue that by any major definition of art many modern video games should be considered art. Rather than defining art and defending video games based on a single contentious definition, I offer reason for thinking that video games can be art.

## Introduction
Jack Kroll argues that "games can be fun and rewarding in many ways, but they can't transmit the emotional complexity that is the root of art".
In an article published in MIT's Technology Review called "Art Form for the digital Age", film scholar Henry Jenkins criticized Kroll for dramatically underestimating the potential of video games.
Despite the cultural prominence of video games and technology-based art, philosophical aesthetics has completely ignored the area.
The fact that philosophers have not raised the question of whether video games can be art lends credence to assumption that they are not.
In this paper I argue that by any major definition of art many modern video games should be considered art.
If we can agree that all these theories generally track our intuitions about what should be considered art, then when they are all in agreement we have good reason to think that we have successfully picked out an art form.
Overall, I argue that while many video games probably should not be considered art, there are good reasons to think that some video games should be classified as art.
